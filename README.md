# Timezones home page

This is a website that shows current time in several timezones, so you use it as your home page for your browser and that way you very easily know the time around the world.

I recommend you use the [Custom new tab URL](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia?hl=en)Chrome extension to set it as the default page for new tabs.

It is based on the [Figured It Out](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/figure-it-out/lialghmkggocekkpjbnoacohodmckfke?hl=en) Chrome extension (free only for two timezones), if you want a more advanced idea, take a look at it.


You can customize the timezones and names for locations under each one. Fork this repo and modify the array you will find at the end of index.html. Then, activate the GitHub pages setting for your new repo, and use your page URL.
